# Why reimplement functionality manually here ?

1. It is fun
2. I learn a lot
3. It decreases compilation times since I don't compile anything I don't need. Short compilation time decreases
   iteration time which encourages exploration of ideas and debugging. It may not be significant for a small project but
   it will be once the project grows bigger.

# Why use only tetrahedron and octahedron ?

Because they are two primitive shapes that can tessellate when combined. A cube can do that too, but it is boring and
overdone. Also, since I am a programmer and a lousy designer, it allows me to build interesting objects easily.
